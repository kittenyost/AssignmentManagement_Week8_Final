PURPOSE OF CHANGE:
Added a "Notes" field to the Assignment class to give users a place to store extra details about tasks.

---
SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
- Updated Assignment constructor and properties to include Notes.
- Adjusted ToString() output to show Notes.
- Updated ConsoleUI to accept and display Notes.
- Fixed IsOverdue() logic to skip completed tasks.

---
TDD PROCESS USED:
- Wrote tests to confirm Notes were not saving.
- Updated model and confirmed tests passed after changes.
- Added coverage for overdue logic and null edge cases.

---
CHALLENGES OR DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Needed to debug Git and push clean files.
- Rebuilt Git history and excluded .vs folder.
- Had to trace incomplete constructor logic that skipped Notes.

---
NEXT STEPS OR RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Add edit support for Notes.
- Consider using DTOs for API in future versions.
