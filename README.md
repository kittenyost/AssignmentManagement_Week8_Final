# Assignment Management System - Maintenance Plan

**Date:** May 27, 2025  
**Author:** Kathy Yost  

## Purpose
This document outlines the maintenance strategy to ensure the long-term health and scalability of the Assignment Management System.

## Goals
- Maintain clean, modular, and testable code.
- Ensure documentation and tests remain current with code changes.
- Minimize technical debt through regular review and refactoring.

## Maintenance Tasks

### 🔄 Regular Reviews
- **Quarterly Code Reviews**: Assess cyclomatic complexity and apply refactors to keep methods under complexity of 10.
- **Dead Code Removal**: Identify and remove unused variables, methods, or classes.
- **Documentation Updates**: Add or update XML comments on public classes and methods.

### 🧪 Testing Strategy
- **Target Coverage**: Maintain 80%+ unit test coverage across all services and logic layers.
- **Regression Tests**: Validate that fixed bugs remain resolved.
- **CI/CD Integration** (future): Incorporate GitHub Actions or similar for automated test runs.

### 🐛 Bug Tracking
- Document any new bugs as GitHub issues.
- Label bugs by severity and expected fix time.
- Resolve high-priority bugs within 7 days of reporting.

### 🧰 Logging and Debugging
- Expand use of `IAppLogger` interface for all service layers.
- Log method start/end for high-impact functions (e.g., AddAssignment, UpdateAssignment).

## Summary
This plan ensures that the Assignment Management System remains functional, user-friendly, and easy to enhance over time.
